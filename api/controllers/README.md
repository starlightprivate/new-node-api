Controllers
===========================

ExpressJS style nodejs code  to be executed for incoming HTTP requests.

I know that code is quite ugly in this files.
Be carefull with changing it.
We have unit tests that covers nearly all actions called by frontend code.
But if you change code here, you will have to
1) verify that unit tests PASS (quite simple)
2) verify that frontend code is not broken. It is much more complicated task - frontend code has worse quality.
