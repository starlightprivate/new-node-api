Tests
==================================

There are unit tests for application.
They can be your greatest friend and greatest enemy.
We emulate clients browser using [supertest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/supertest)
and call various API endpoints.
In meantime, we trigger CSRF security, blocking bots security and so on - as result, we have good code coverage.


If you want to change them, please, be carefull.
